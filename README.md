# Apex-Crypter
A runtime win32 (PE , x86) encrypter designed to bypass scantime and runtime analysis of antivirus modules.

Code is provided as is there will be no planned updates. 
Only projects that are uploaded are the C# engine used to build the PE container, complete nasm container source, masm polymorphic engine.
May not compile because probably has references to the client/server communications, however we are most likely not going to upload those.

Have fun, this is probably the most powerful public source available.

- Much love to all those who have helped us and supported us along the way.
